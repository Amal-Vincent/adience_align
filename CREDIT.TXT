This implements a face alignment method, as preprocessing to tasks such as age and gender estimation, and face recognition as described in [5] and [6].

The code calls an executable of facial landmarks detection, by X.Zhu and D. Ramanan, implementing the algorithm described in [1]. It includes pre-trained face models. Much of the detection code is built on top of part-based model implementation of [2]. The training code implements a quadratic program (QP) solver described in [3].

In the training code, we use the positive samples from MultiPIE dataset (available at www.multipie.org) and the negative images from the INRIAPerson dataset [4] (included in the package). 

Acknowledgements: We graciously thank the authors of the previous code releases and image benchmarks for making them publicly available.
